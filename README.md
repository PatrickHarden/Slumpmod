# SlumpMod

*[From the original reddit /r/ChivalryGame post]*

This mod is based off an older version of Mercs mod but has now been updated to roughly the same point as Mercs 1.995 except for some additions detailed below. Hopefully active development will continue for a good while as the game clings on to dear life. The aim of this mod is to make the game more fun and balanced for competitive players so that they don't get completely bored of the game just yet.

Balance decisions will be undertaken by a myself and a few others (mostly for practical reasons - a full balance council has been tried in the past and failed). However of course we will be open to suggestions - you can discuss them here on reddit or on the steam workshop page (links below).

You can see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/vincegogh/SlumpMod/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), the source code can be found [here](http://github.com/vincegogh/SlumpMod/), and the steam workshop page can be found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799351461). The list of known bugs can be found [here](http://github.com/vincegogh/SlumpMod/issues) - do feel free to add them directly or contact me if you find anything. Note that source code contributions that affect balance are unlikely to be accepted unless they have been properly discussed on the steam page or reddit.
